# Predict Customer Churn
### First Projec Machine Learning Engineer DevOps Nanodegree

In this project, the job is to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. This repository includes a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package has the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).

The data used is called Credit Card Customers, you can download it from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers/code)

The skeleton project included a [Jupyter Notebook file with the data loading, data exploration, data segregation, model training and testing](https://github.com/apolanco3225/customer-churn/blob/main/churn_notebook.ipynb). In the following files I tried to improve this process, making it more adequate for a production environment.

This project contains:
* churn_library.py: Modular and reproducible.
* churn_script_logging_and_tests.py: Making sure tests are added in the model pipeline.
